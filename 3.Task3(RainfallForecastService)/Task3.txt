Get actual data if the date is in the past (i.e., if
actual rainfall is available)

if(rainfallForecastDSP.isWaterQuantityExist(date))
{
            return rainfallForecastDSP.getRFData(date);
}
I have created a service which will check if given date is in the past and call service.
What attributes should I return in rainfallForecastDSP.getRFData(date) service?


select * from water_quantity_rf where location_id=2025 order by update_ts desc limit 1;
